# Complex Event Processing (CEP) Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up Complex Event Processing (CEP) using Apache Flink for your healthcare analytics project. CEP allows you to detect patterns and events in real-time data streams, which is essential for identifying critical health anomalies, like irregular heartbeats.

## Prerequisites

- [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) installed and configured.
- A running Apache Kafka instance to provide the data stream.

## Steps

### 1. Create a CEP Job

1. Open your Java IDE or preferred development environment.

2. Create a new Java class, for example, `AbnormalHeartRatePattern`.

3. Configure the Flink environment and create a data stream from the Kafka topic containing healthcare sensor data.

4. Define a pattern using Flink's CEP library. For example, to detect abnormal heart rates:
   - Start with `Pattern.begin("start")`.
   - Use `SimpleCondition` to filter the events based on the required conditions (e.g., heart rate > 100).
   - Specify a time window using `.within(Time.seconds(windowSize))`.

5. Create a pattern stream using `CEP.pattern()`.

6. Define a `PatternSelectFunction` to process detected patterns and generate alerts.

7. Print the alerts to the console or save them to a suitable data store.

### 2. Running the CEP Job

1. Build the project and package the JAR file containing your CEP job class.

2. Submit the JAR file to your Flink cluster using the following command:
   ```shell
   bin/flink run -c path.to.your.AbnormalHeartRatePattern /path/to/your/jar-file.jar
   ```

3. Monitor the Flink job in the Flink Web UI.

### 3. Testing

1. Ensure that your Kafka data generator is producing data to the specified Kafka topic.

2. Observe the Flink job's output in the console or the destination you configured.

3. Test different heart rate scenarios to verify that the CEP algorithm correctly detects abnormal heart rates and generates alerts.

### 4. Additional Configuration

1. You can further customize the CEP patterns and conditions to match your specific use case.

2. Experiment with different window sizes and conditions to fine-tune the accuracy of abnormality detection.

### 5. Integration with Other Components

1. Integrate the generated alerts from the CEP job with other components like a dashboard or alerting system.

2. Consider using Apache Kafka to stream the alerts to other systems for further processing.
