# Healthcare Analytics Project

This project aims to revolutionize healthcare analytics by introducing real-time data streaming, event-based execution, and complex event processing (CEP). The project leverages Apache Flink, Apache Kafka, and Eclipse Ditto to provide real-time insights into healthcare data, enabling timely interventions and proactive patient care.

## Project Overview

The current healthcare analytics paradigm primarily relies on scheduled batch processing, resulting in significant latency between data generation and analysis. This project addresses this challenge by:

- Implementing real-time data streaming using Apache Kafka.
- Developing Apache Flink jobs for event-based data processing and complex event detection.
- Leveraging Eclipse Ditto for creating virtual representations of healthcare assets (Digital Twins).
- Providing real-time alerts for critical events and anomalies using CEP algorithms.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools and components installed:

- Java JDK 8 or higher.
- [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) installed and configured.
- [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) installed and running.
- [Eclipse Ditto](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/) installed and configured.

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/IshaanAdarsh/healthcare-analytics.git
   cd healthcare-analytics
   ```

2. **Configure Apache Flink, Apache Kafka, and Eclipse Ditto**:

   - Follow their respective installation guides to set them up.

3. **Set up the Data Generator**:

   - Simulate streaming healthcare sensor data. Instructions in [data-generator/README.md](data-generator/README.md).

4. **Configure and Run Apache Flink Jobs**:

   - Process streaming data and detect anomalies. Instructions in [flink-jobs/README.md](flink-jobs/README.md).

5. **Implement Digital Twin with Eclipse Ditto**:

   - Enable predictive maintenance and condition monitoring. Instructions in [digital-twin/README.md](digital-twin/README.md).

6. **Integrate Components**:

   - Integrate different components for a holistic healthcare analytics solution.

```

## Usage

1. Start Apache Kafka and ensure it's running.

2. Run the data generator to produce simulated healthcare sensor data.

3. Submit the Apache Flink jobs using `flink run` command.

4. Observe the Flink Web UI and logs for job progress and alerts.

5. Monitor the Ditto logs to see Digital Twin updates.

## Components

- **Data Generator**: Simulates streaming healthcare sensor data. Setup instructions in [data-generator/README.md](data-generator/README.md).

- **Flink Jobs**: Processes streaming data and detects anomalies using CEP. Setup instructions in [flink-jobs/README.md](flink-jobs/README.md).

- **Digital Twin**: Implements virtual representations of healthcare assets for predictive maintenance. Setup instructions in [digital-twin/README.md](digital-twin/README.md).

## Testing

1. Ensure that Kafka is running and receiving data from the data generator.

2. Start the Flink jobs and observe their output in the Flink Web UI.

3. Monitor the Ditto logs to verify Digital Twin updates.

4. Test different healthcare scenarios to validate real-time analytics and anomaly detection.
