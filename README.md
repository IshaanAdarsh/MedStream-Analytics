# Healthcare Analytics Project

This project aims to revolutionize healthcare analytics by introducing real-time data streaming, event-based execution, and complex event processing (CEP). The project leverages Apache Flink, Apache Kafka, and Eclipse Ditto to provide real-time insights into healthcare data, enabling timely interventions and proactive patient care.

## Project Overview

The current healthcare analytics paradigm primarily relies on scheduled batch processing, resulting in significant latency between data generation and analysis. This project addresses this challenge by:
- Implementing real-time data streaming using Apache Kafka.
- Developing Apache Flink jobs for event-based data processing and complex event detection.
- Leveraging Eclipse Ditto for creating virtual representations of healthcare assets (Digital Twins).
- Providing real-time alerts for critical events and anomalies using CEP algorithms.

## Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher.
- [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) installed and configured.
- [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) installed and running.
- [Eclipse Ditto](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/) installed and configured.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/IshaanAdarsh/healthcare-analytics.git
   cd healthcare-analytics
   ```

2. Configure Apache Flink, Apache Kafka, and Eclipse Ditto according to their respective installation guides.

3. Set up the data generator to simulate streaming healthcare data. Follow the instructions in the [data-generator](data-generator/README.md) directory.

4. Configure and run the Apache Flink jobs for processing streaming data and detecting anomalies. Follow the instructions in the [flink-jobs](flink-jobs/README.md) directory.

5. Implement Digital Twin functionality using Eclipse Ditto for predictive maintenance and condition monitoring. Follow the instructions in the [digital-twin](digital-twin/README.md) directory.

6. Integrate the components for a holistic healthcare analytics solution.

## Directory Structure

- `data-generator`: Simulates streaming healthcare sensor data.
- `flink-jobs`: Contains Apache Flink jobs for event-based processing and anomaly detection.
- `digital-twin`: Implements Digital Twin functionality using Eclipse Ditto.
- `kafka-configuration`: Contains Kafka configuration files and a guide on how to configure Kafka.
- `README.md`: This main project README file.

## Usage

1. Start Apache Kafka and ensure it's running.

2. Run the data generator to produce simulated healthcare sensor data.

3. Submit the Apache Flink jobs using `flink run` command.

4. Observe the Flink Web UI and logs for job progress and alerts.

5. Monitor the Ditto logs to see Digital Twin updates.

## Components

- **Data Generator**: Simulates streaming healthcare sensor data. Follow the [data-generator README](data-generator/README.md) for setup instructions.

- **Flink Jobs**: Processes streaming data and detects anomalies using CEP. Follow the [flink-jobs README](flink-jobs/README.md) for setup instructions.

- **Digital Twin**: Implements virtual representations of healthcare assets for predictive maintenance. Follow the [digital-twin README](digital-twin/README.md) for setup instructions.

## Testing

1. Ensure that Kafka is running and receiving data from the data generator.

2. Start the Flink jobs and observe their output in the Flink Web UI.

3. Monitor the Ditto logs to verify Digital Twin updates.

4. Test different healthcare scenarios to validate real-time analytics and anomaly detection.
